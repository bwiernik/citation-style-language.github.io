The Citation Style Language (CSL)  team is proud to announce CSL 1.0, a free and open XML language  for the formatting of citations and bibliographies.
<h2>A New Home</h2>
<a href="../">CitationStyles.org</a> is the new home of the CSL project,  hosting the schema, documentation, project news, and more. In the near  future <a href="http://CitationStyles.org">CitationStyles.org</a> will also host the style repository currently  found at <a href="http://www.zotero.org/styles">www.zotero.org/styles</a>.
<h2>By Academics, for Academics</h2>
CSL 1.0 has been developed by  academics, for academics. The members of the development team hail from  diverse fields, covering social science, law, and natural  science. We are keenly aware of the diverse and demanding requirements of scholars  working in different languages and different fields of research.  At the end of an intensive year of development work, we feel confident that CSL 1.0 marks an important step forward in academic productivity.
<h2>New features</h2>
The top 5 new features that we  would like to highlight:
<ul>
	<li><strong>In-field markup</strong>: CSL 1.0 compatible  programs now support markup within titles, with support for <sup>superscript</sup>,  <sub>subscript</sub>, <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">small capitals</span>,  <em>italics</em> and <strong>boldface</strong>.</li>
	<li><strong>Full localization</strong>: whereas CSL 0.8 only offered  localization of terms, CSL 1.0 offers full style localization, adding  support for localized dates and punctuation.</li>
	<li><strong>Names</strong>: many new  features are related to names. Name disambiguation has been refined, and name particles ("van" in "Ludwig van Beethoven") can now be sorted and rendered according to conventions that reflect the culture and personal preferences of each author.</li>
	<li><strong>Documentation</strong>: the schema for the 1.0 release is accompanied by a  full set of documentation. A <a href="http://citationstyles.org/downloads/specification.html">specification</a> gives all the details on CSL 1.0, and <a href="http://citationstyles.org/downloads/upgrade-notes.html">upgrade notes</a> discuss the changes made between CSL 0.8 and  1.0. A <a href="http://citationstyles.org/downloads/primer.html">primer</a> offers a concise tutorial on editing CSL 1.0 styles.</li>
	<li><strong>CSL processors</strong>: CSL 1.0 is released alongside <a href="http://bitbucket.org/fbennett/citeproc-js/wiki/Home">citeproc-js</a>, the first CSL 1.0  compatible CSL processor, as well as a CSL 1.0 test suite. Various features of CSL 1.0 and citeproc-js can be seen in action in the <a href="http://gsl-nagoya-u.net/http/pub/citeproc-demo/demo.html">online demo</a>. Adding support for CSL was never easier.</li>
</ul>
CSL 1.0 includes many more  improvements. For a full overview, see the <a href="http://citationstyles.org/downloads/upgrade-notes.html">upgrade-notes</a>.
<h2>Using Existing Styles</h2>
Zotero support for CSL 1.0 is scheduled for Zotero 2.1. When released, the Zotero team will upgrade the more than thousand CSL 0.8 styles hosted in the <a href="http://zotero.org/styles">Zotero  Style Repository</a>. To upgrade a CSL 0.8 style yourself, follow the <a href="http://citationstyles.org/downloads/upgrade-notes.html#updating-csl-0-8-styles">upgrade  procedure</a>.
